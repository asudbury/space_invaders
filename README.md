Canvas based space shooter written in ~600 lines. I hacked this together during my early days of javascripting, and left it here for shame. Hope you like spaghetti 🍝

[Give it a go!](https://spaceinvaders.getivor.com/) I made it to level 25.

It's written in vanilla CoffeeScript, no frameworks were used.
