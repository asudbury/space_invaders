I wanted to learn canvas basics so I decided to make my first javascript game... with lots of explosions.

[Give it a go!](http://oldboyfx.com/space_shooter/) I made it to level 25.

It's written in vanilla CoffeeScript, no frameworks were used. I did use the excellent [howler.js](http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library) web audio lib though.
